## How Selection Sort Works  
1. Find the **smallest element** in the unsorted part of the list.  
2. Swap it with the **first element** of the unsorted part.  
3. Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts one step forward.  
4. Repeat until the entire list is sorted.  

## Time Complexity  
- **Best Case:** `O(n²)`  
- **Average Case:** `O(n²)`  
- **Worst Case:** `O(n²)`  

## Space Complexity  
- `O(1)` (In-place sorting, no extra space required)

## Code Implementation (C++)
