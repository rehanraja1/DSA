# Bubble Sort

## Introduction
Bubble sort is a basic sorting method for a list of items, where it repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent items to move the larger ones to the end of the list until the entire list is sorted.

## Example
### Input:
```
[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
```

### Output:
```
[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```
