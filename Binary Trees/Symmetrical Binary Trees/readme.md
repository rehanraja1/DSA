# Symmetric Binary Tree

## Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary tree with N nodes. Determine whether it is symmetric or not.

## Note
- A binary tree is considered symmetric if its mirror image is identical to that of the original tree.
- If we were to draw a vertical line through the center of the tree, the nodes on the left side and the right side should mirror each other.

## Example 1

**Input:**
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

**Output:**
```
True
```

## Example 2

**Input:**
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

**Output:**
