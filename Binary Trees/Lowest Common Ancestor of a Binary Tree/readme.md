# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## Problem Statement
You're given the root of a binary tree and two nodes from the tree, labeled as `p` and `q`. Your task is to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes `p` and `q`.

## Note
- The lowest common ancestor (LCA) is the node located deepest in the tree that serves as an ancestor to two nodes.
- A node is considered as its own descendant.

## Example 1

### Input:
```
       3
      / \
     5   1
    / \  / \
   6  2 0  8
     / \
    7   4

p = 5, q = 1
```

### Output:
```
LCA = 3
```

### Input:
```
       8
      / \
     4   12
        /  \
       10   14

p = 4, q = 14
```

### Output:
```
LCA = 8
