# Remove Duplicates

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, your task is to remove any duplicate elements from the array. After removing duplicates, print the number of unique elements and the modified array.

Ensure that the first 'k' elements in the array contain the final result, where 'k' is the number of unique elements.

There are no specific requirements for the order of elements beyond 'k' in the array.

## Example 1

### Input:
```
[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
```

### Output:
```
5
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
