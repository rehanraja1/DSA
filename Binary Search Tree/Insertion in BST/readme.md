# Insertion in Binary Search Tree

## Introduction
Insertion in a Binary Search Tree (BST) involves adding a node while maintaining the binary search property of the tree. Each node in a BST has at most two children, where the left child contains values smaller than the parent node, and the right child contains values greater than the parent node.

## Input
- A Binary Search Tree (BST)
- A value to be inserted into the BST

## Output
- A BST with the new value inserted while preserving the BST property
